## Goal <a name="objetivo"></a>

The idea of this project is to write a *modbus TCP* server in C++ to run on the Raspiberry Pi. The aim here is to be as didactic as possible, so there are lots of comments throughout the code.  
My mother tongue is Portuguese, so you can find comments in both languages, English and Portuguese.  
I haven't worried about performance or following *Design Patterns*, although suggestions for improving the code are very welcome.  
There is also an example application to make it easier to understand how it can be used.  


## Motivation <a name="motivacao"></a>

I couldn't easily find an implementation of a *modbus TCP* server in C++, so I decided to write my own. However, I did find this nice work by [Mazurel](https://github.com/Mazurel/Modbus), which I suggest you also use as a reference in your studies.


## Installation <a name="instalacao"></a>

If you want to download and compile the code, I suggest this page to configure the development environment.
