[Goal](#objetivo)  
[Motivation](#motivacao)  

## Goal <a name="objetivo"></a>
The idea of this project is to build a modbus server in C++. It should be easy to use and apply to other projects.

## Motivation <a name="motivacao"></a>
It was not easy to find many modbus servers in C++. I found this nice work [here](https://github.com/Mazurel/Modbus) but decided to develop my own.
